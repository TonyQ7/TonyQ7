## Hi there 👋

I’m Tony — student at two independent degree propgrams BSc Information and Communication Technology at KTH and BSc Business and Economics at the Stockholm School of Economics. I enjoy building practical software, reasoning from data, and shipping things that combine engineering with measurable commercial outcomes.

### What I’m working on

* Recent experience fine-tuning computer vision models and wiring ML into ops workflows at a seed-stage startup.
* Representing KTH internationally as an official international ambassador, and helping to host Scandinavia’s largest career fair with 140+ corporate partners. 

### Experience highlights

* **Computer Vision & Software Engineering Intern @ Pango (SSE Business Lab)** — fine-tuned models for automated recognition of customer returns and built pipelines that integrated with existing IT to streamline e-commerce logistics. 
* **International Ambassador, KTH EECS** — contracted role in global student outreach and recruitment. 
* **Career Fair Host, THS Armada** — facilitated interactions between students and 140+ partners, including Revolut and Flow Traders. 
* **Laboratory Assistant, KTH EECS** — part-time support for lab activities. 
* **Independent Trader** — leveraged CFD exposure across WTI crude and equity index futures, delivering 2000%+ cumulative after-tax return since Mar 2020, with P&L verification available on request. 
* Built and shipped web solutions for two small enterprises in Shanghai and Sweden.
